# Fulll test - Frontend

This project is a React-based application that allows users to search for GitHub using the GitHub REST API.

**Here is the list of the main features:**

✅ **Debounced search:** prevents unnecessary API calls by waiting for the user to stop typing.

✅ **Loading and error handling:** displays a loader while fetching and meaningful error messages.

✅ **Rate limit awareness:** if the GitHub API rate limit is reached, the user is informed when they can retry.
